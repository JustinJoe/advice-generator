## My process
I started with looking at the design, breaking it down it into blocks, and then elements. This helped me write resusable rules for my CSS and also made it easier to structure my code for the mobile and desktop layouts. I then moved on to building out the HTML, CSS and JS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com)

### What I learned

I learnt how to position a block or element with Position and Transform.

```html
<h1 class="position">Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.position {
  position: absolute,
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform:translate(-50%, -50%)
}
```

### Continued development

I'll be reading more on positioning in CSS to get a better grasp on it.
